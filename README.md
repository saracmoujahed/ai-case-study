# Grammarly’s Impact on the AI Landscape

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammarly is the leader in digital writing assistance, helping English-speaking users across various fields and demographics with grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style errors. Providing real-time advice on grammar, clarity, and tone, Grammarly has an extensive array of features to help its users with their online communication. This includes academic papers, emails, social media posts, and more, allowing its use to be widely appreciated by everyday users, academics, and businesses alike. Founded in 2009 by Max Lytvyn, Alex Shevchenko, and Dmytro Lider, their goal was to create software that helped people write and communicate more effectively. According to the company's website,

>“Their first version of Grammarly was a subscription-based product focused on grammar and spelling for students. However, they soon saw that Grammarly's potential was far beyond the initial product.”[1]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammarly is designed to enhance human abilities, making communication online clearer and easier for everyone while maintaining the individual voice of its user and the essential context. Originally, the intended customers were students, and while this is still the dominant user, the application is used by professionals and even job seekers as well. The company boasts over 30 million daily active users and 70,000 professional teams that use Grammerly, making up 96% of all Fortune 500 companies.[3] There are similar companies that have ridden on the coattails of Grammarly, including ProWritingAid and Writer, but they are limited in comparison. Grammarly provides more features overall for both the free and paid users, including the highest word limit, plagiarism detection, and even cover letter generation. Given their sustained popularity and headstart in the game, this gives them an advantage in the amount of data they’re able to utilize from their users.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammarly is built on the AI analysis of text, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. These subfields of artificial intelligence are what make up the programs behind all chatbots, predictive texts, and language translation applications, giving them the ability to speak and learn without being programmed explicitly. Using algorithms that utilize deep learning, we can use neural networks to mimic the human brain to handle and correlate large amounts of unstructured data.[4] This is essential for language processing software because language, especially the English language, can be so nuanced. Another well-known technology that utilized NLP over the last decade is Apple's AI assistant, Siri. Introduced in 2011,

>“Apple’s Siri became known as one of the world’s first successful NLP/AI assistants. Siri’s automated speech recognition module translates the owner’s words into digitally interpreted concepts, and then the voice-command system matches those concepts to predefined commands, initiating specific actions.”[5]

Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home devices use a similar structure, becoming more advanced in their capabilities over the years due to machine learning. In 2018, OpenAI released its first GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) followed by the more widely known predecessor, ChatGPT in 2022.[6][7] 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grammarly has had a significant impact on businesses and everyday users alike. Businesses have reported that 
>
>“Grammarly saves them an average of 19 working days—an estimated $5,000+—per employee per year. For a company of 1,000 employees, that’s over $5.1 million in annual savings and over 17X return on investment”.[3]

For most businesses, Grammarly is the only choice because, with their browser extension, the application is available across all the company's apps and tools and doesn't compromise security and privacy. The only area Grammarly seems to fall short in is its inclusiveness for other languages. Currently, only English is supported, and while it is the highest percentage of languages spoken, this only makes up 18% of the world's population.[8] The company could use its machine learning algorithms to expand to other languages whose speakers may also be able to utilize their product, implementing teams of native speakers to ensure accuracy. Advances like this could improve translation applications across the board and help bridge the gap between what is translated and the actual meaning. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Grammarly has cemented its status as the premier digital writing assistant, enhancing communication for millions of users across various fields. Utilizing advanced AI technologies like natural language processing and machine learning, it delivers real-time feedback that improves clarity and style. With over 30 million daily active users and significant productivity gains for businesses, Grammarly demonstrates its value beyond just student use. While it currently focuses on the English language, expanding its capabilities to include other languages could open new opportunities for growth and inclusivity. As digital communication evolves, Grammarly’s commitment to innovation will keep it at the forefront of writing assistance.* Grammarly was utilized during the duration of writing this case study, contributing to the professional tone and conciseness.
